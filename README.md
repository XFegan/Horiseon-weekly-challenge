# Horiseon Weekly Challenge

This website is used to market the company and what the best ways to do so. Such as, through social media marketing, brand awarness, SEO, etc. 

What I did to help the website began with changing the div elements to the correct HTML elements. Those elements included elments such as sections, articles, headers, ect. 

I also took the time to leave comments through the index.html and CSS file to explain the correct selectors and what was consolidated to make the file easier to work with.
